     * Checked and reviewed the code from last year project: 
               * Out of all the functions maybe 3 or 4 are usable
               * The rest are either incomplete or a mess 
               * No description is available

     * Attended the meeting with Albert. Interesting points emerged:
               * Start with an easy pipeline
               * Have an HMM working
               * Spend all the rest of the time on the pre-processing part of the project

 Read the following papers:
 *  _"*An Off-Line Cursive Handwriting Recognition System*"_ (1998) of Andrew W. Senior and Anthony J. Robinson
            * The paper describes a complete system for the recognition of off-line handwriting. Preprocessing techniques are described, including segmentation and normalization of word images to give invariance to scale, slant, slope and stroke thickness
            * It is a good paper to start with, and it gives a really good overview of how a full system work.
 *  _"*Off-line Cursive Handwriting Recognition*"_ from last year students 
            * The paper describes more or less the same system described in the previous paper

   * _"*Using Lexical Similarity in Handwritten Word Recognition*"_ (2000) of J. Park and V. Govindaraju
            * The paper presents a method to capture lexical similarity of a lexicon and realiability of a character recognizer which serve to capture the dynamism of the environment
           * I personally did not find the paper really interesting for what we have in mind

   * _"*A Recognition and Verification Strategy for Handwritten Word Recognition*"_ (2003) of M. Morita, R. Sabourin, F. Bortolozzi and Y. Suen
           * The main contribution of the work presented in the paper lies in the validation of the strategy used to recognition. 
           * The paper is not that interesting for our purpose, except for one thing: in the paper they use two features sets: the first based on global features (such as loops, ascenders and descenders), while the second one is based on concavity measurements. Both features sets are combined with space primitives.

    * Attended the meeting with Albert Salah 
    * Searched for papers on the topic
    * Talked with all the team members about what we want to restrict our research (the topic is touching an huge amount of sub-topics)
