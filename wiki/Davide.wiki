     * Checked and reviewed the code from last year project: 
               * Out of all the functions maybe 3 or 4 are usable. 
               * The rest are either incomplete or a mess. 
               * No description is available.

     * Attended the meeting with Albert. Interesting points emerged:
               * Start with an easy pipeline
               * Have an HMM working
               * Spend all the rest of the time on the pre-processing part of the project.
